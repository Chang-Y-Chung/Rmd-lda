Sample Log
----------

We read the program effort data from the course website and list the
first three observations

```stata
use http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/effort
list in 1/3
```

Next we draw a scatterplot matrix

```stata
graph matrix change setting effort
graph export sample.png, width(500) replace
```
<img class="center" src="sample.png"/>

That's all folks!

## More Logs

This is an examples from Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal (2012) section 3.4.1.

We are fitting a linear random-intercept model with covariates:

<!--
$y_{ij} = \beta_1 + \beta_{2}x_{2ij} + \ldots + \beta_{p}x_{pij} + (\zeta_j + \epsilon_{ij})$

The above works fine on sample.html, with:

- pandoc option --mathjax
- and including the mathjax script in the html header

But the url2pdf does not seem to handle mathjax correctly!!! *Arrrrgh*
