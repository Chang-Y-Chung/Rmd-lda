Rmd-lda
-------

Prof. Rodriguez's Literate Data Analysis (LDA) stata command, `weave`, works
great! See http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/stata/weave.

Here is one example of utilizing the command. Write a R markup with stata
chunks and produce a pdf _directly_, thanks to:

- pandoc http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/
- url2pdf https://github.com/scottgarner/URL2PDF
- and little bit of scripting (this could be done with sed or awk, I guess)
